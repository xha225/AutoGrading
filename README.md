** Goal **

Find a way to do automated program grading.
For example, the tool should take the source code (a student's programing assignment) and output a grade.

** Approach **

Method-I
int AutoGrading(studentSourceCode)
{
 // algorithm
}

Method-II
An alternative approach may be to create an interactive learning environment.

The grading is done with each subsection.
But is there a way to make this from within visual studio?




** Schedule **

Starting from 09/12/21

Week 1 - 4: research on the existing methodologies

Week 6 - 10: develop a tool to automate the process (writing code, scripts, etc.)
