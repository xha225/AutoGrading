# Goal

Find a way to do automated program grading.
For example, the tool should take the source code (a student's programing assignment) and output a grade.


# Approach

Method-I
int AutoGrading(studentSourceCode)
{
 // algorithm
}


Method-II
An alternative approach may be to create an interactive learning environment.

.Net Notebooks

The grading is done with each subsection.
But is there a way to make this from within visual studio?



# Schedule

Starting from 09/12/21

Week 1 - 4: research on the existing methodologies

Week 6 - 10: develop a tool to automate the process (writing code, scripts, etc.)

# Logs
10/15 Moodle framework to use for the front and back end

# Questions
1. How to build a new assignment in Moodle?
3. Does Moodle support something like the Jupyter notebook for C# (we need to have C# compiler/runtime on the web UI)? If not, how do we integrate Jupyter notebook?
4. How should we host the website? Can we host it with AWS?
5.
