The Moodle Virtual Programming Lab (VPL) interface offers many options when executing code. 
There are 4 default files included to be used when running code in VPL: run, debug, evaluate, and evaluate cases.
The first 3 of these are very similar, they provided a place to add code that is executed when run, debug or evaluate buttons are hit. 
This allows you to designate different events for the different operations for the different ways students can run their code. For many implementations this may be unncessary. 
The evaulate cases file is were you put test cases, and provided in VPL is a syntax for creating basic tests. 
For more advanced tests, the VPL provides the ability for a test case to run a seprate bash script that is created and saved in the moodle editor.
Provided is the link to the Virtual Programming Documents for an overview of how to use the package to create 
programming assignments in Moodle(https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/index.html)
